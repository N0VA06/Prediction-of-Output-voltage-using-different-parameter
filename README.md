Prediction of Output voltage using different-parameters In this section, we describe the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset before training the models. Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning tasks as it helps improve model performance and ensures the integrity of the analysis.

Dataset Description To enhance the predictive capabilities and realism of the model, we have incorporated a comprehensive set of 23 different features into the dataset. These features cover a wide range of operational parameters and environmental conditions, ensuring a detailed and accurate representation of the PEM fuel cell system's performance. The features include time (, which tracks the elapsed time during the fuel cell's operation and is crucial for understanding temporal dynamics and transient behaviors. Total voltage is included to indicate the electrical performance and efficiency of the fuel cell, while current provides data on the current produced, helping to calculate power output and overall energy conversion efficiency. Power output is derived from voltage and current, essential for assessing energy output and performance under various loads. Additionally, mass flow rates of air and hydrogen are measured to ensure the correct supply of reactants needed for the electrochemical reactions. Relative humidity of air and hydrogen are included to account for the moisture content, which affects the membrane conductivity and overall efficiency. Inlet and outlet pressures are critical for understanding the flow dynamics and maintaining optimal goperating conditions. Multiple temperature points provide detailed information on the thermal state of the system, which is vital for managing heat and preventing overheating. Furthermore, the dataset includes recorded mass flow rates of air and hydrogen, heater power, and recorded current) to offer comprehensive insights into the operational conditions and system responses. By integrating these features, the model can more accurately predict the performance and stability of PEM fuel cell systems under different operational scenarios. This detailed approach addresses existing gaps in capturing the transient dynamics of PEM fuel cells, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions and contributing to the development of more efficient and robust fuel cell technologies.
Standardization Standardization, also known as Z-score normalization, is a common preprocessing technique used to rescale features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process involves subtracting the mean of each feature from the dataset and dividing it by the standard deviation. Standardization is particularly useful when the features have different scales or units of measurement. By standardizing the data, we ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process, preventing any one feature from dominating due to its scale. The formula for standardization is as follows:
• X is the original feature value. • μ is the mean of the feature across the dataset. • σ is the standard deviation of the feature across the dataset. • Xstandarized is the standardized feature value.

Preprocessing The dataset was pre-processed using standardization before being fed into the machine learning models. Each feature in the dataset was standardized independently, ensuring that the scale of each feature was consistent across the dataset. The standardization process was implemented using the Standard Scaler class from the scikit-learn library in Python. This class computes the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training set and then applies the transformation to both the training and test sets. This ensures that the same transformation is applied consistently to all data points, maintaining the integrity of the dataset.
Advantages of Standardization Standardization offers several advantages in the context of machine learning:
Improved Model Performance: Standardization ensures that features are on a consistent scale, which can lead to improved model convergence and performance.

Robustness to Outliers: Standardization is less affected by outliers compared to other scaling methods like min-max scaling, as it uses the mean and standard deviation, which are less sensitive to extreme values.

Interpretability: Standardized features are more interpretable as they represent the number of standard deviations away from the mean, allowing for easier comparison and interpretation of feature importance.

Model Selection For the initial phase of model selection and training, straightforward algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Linear Regression are often selected, tailored to the problem's requirements and dataset characteristics. These models serve as a baseline to understand the basic relationships in the data. After splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, these models are trained and their performance is assessed using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or mean squared error, depending on the nature of the problem. By comparing factors like accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, the most suitable baseline model can be determined. In addition to these simpler models, more sophisticated algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost Regressor are also incorporated. Random Forest, being an ensemble method, combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness, making it particularly effective for complex datasets with non-linear relationships. XGBoost Regressor, known for its high performance and scalability, utilizes gradient boosting to optimize model predictions iteratively, often outperforming other methods in terms of predictive accuracy. During the model evaluation phase, the performance of these advanced models is compared against the baseline models. Comprehensive metrics, including accuracy, interpretability, computational efficiency, and the models' ability to handle overfitting or underfitting, are considered. This thorough comparison helps identify the most effective model for the given problem.
B. SIMULINK MODEL

System Design and components To simulate a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) system using Simulink, we first define the essential components: a hydrogen fuel source with a ramp mechanism, a flow rate selector switch, a saturation flow rate regulator, a fuel cell stack with 100 cells, a DC boost converter, and a DC-DC converter. These components are integrated into a Simulink model to form a comprehensive system for performance evaluation.
Hydrogen fuel cell and flow control The simulation begins by modelling the hydrogen fuel source with a ramp mechanism to provide a controlled and gradually increasing hydrogen flow. This is implemented using a Ramp block in Simulink, which generates a time-based linear increase in hydrogen flow rate. A flow rate selector switch is added to enable the selection of different pre-set flow rates, allowing the simulation to explore various operating conditions. This switch can be modelled using a Multiport Switch block. The selected flow rate is then regulated by a saturation flow rate regulator, ensuring the flow does not exceed the fuel cell's maximum capacity. The regulator is implemented using a Saturation block, which constrains the flow rate within defined upper and lower limits.

Simulation parameters The performance of the PEMFC system is highly dependent on the hydrogen flow rate. During the simulation, various flow rates are tested to determine the optimal flow rate that maximizes efficiency and power output. The Ramp block's slope is adjusted to simulate different flow rate increase rates, and the flow rate selector switch is used to test various initial and final flow rates. Key performance parameters such as voltage, current, power output, and fuel cell efficiency are monitored using Scope blocks and Data Logging features in Simulink. Optimal flow rate determination involves analysing these parameters to find the flow rate that provides the best balance between high power output and fuel efficiency without causing over-saturation or inefficiency in the fuel cell stack. There are two scopes as mentioned in figure 1 which will measure and give graphs about what is actually going on the simulation. These will be further discussed on results section. III. RESULTS In this section, we present and analyze the performance outcomes of five distinct models applied to our dataset: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, a Linear Regression model, a Decision Tree model, a Random Forest model, and an XGBoost Regressor model. Each model was trained and evaluated using a standardized dataset to ensure a fair comparison. The primary performance metrics used for evaluation include accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and computational efficiency. The ANN model, known for its capability to capture complex non-linear relationships within data, was configured with multiple layers and neurons. Training was conducted using the backpropagation algorithm, and various hyperparameters, including learning rate and batch size, were optimized through cross-validation. The performance of the ANN model was assessed based on its predictive accuracy and error rates across the test data. The Linear Regression model, serving as a baseline, assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This model was trained using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Despite its simplicity, linear regression provides valuable insights into the fundamental trends and serves as a benchmark to evaluate the enhancements provided by more complex models. The SVM model, employing a kernel trick to handle non-linear data separations, was implemented with various kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). The model's performance was fine-tuned through grid search to identify the optimal parameters. SVM's robustness in high-dimensional spaces and its generalization capabilities were critically analyzed. The Random Forest model, an ensemble learning method, was implemented to combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Hyperparameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth were optimized through cross-validation. This model is particularly effective for complex datasets with non-linear relationships. The XGBoost Regressor model, known for its high performance and scalability, utilizes gradient boosting to optimize model predictions iteratively. Various hyperparameters, including learning rate, maximum depth, and number of estimators, were fine-tuned to enhance performance. This model is often preferred for its predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The subsequent sections delve into the detailed results of each model. We compare their predictive accuracies, error metrics, and computational efficiencies. The insights gained from these comparisons provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's strengths and limitations in the context of our specific application. The performance of the Linear Regression model was assessed based on two key metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R-Squared value. The RMSE value provides a measure of the average magnitude of the error. It is the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. For our Linear Regression model, the RMSE was calculated to be 0.29717, corresponding to a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.08831. This relatively low RMSE and MSE value indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, close to the actual values, suggesting good predictive accuracy for a linear model. The R-Squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination, indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The R-Squared value for our model was found to be 0.81. This means that 81% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. An R-Squared value of 0.81 is generally considered high, indicating a strong linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The RMSE value of 0.29717 and MSE value of 0.08831 demonstrate that the model's error rate is reasonably low, which is favorable for prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, the R-Squared value of 0.81 signifies that the Linear Regression model captures the majority of the variability in the dataset, making it a robust model for explaining the linear relationship between variables. However, it is important to note that while the Linear Regression model shows strong performance metrics, its assumption of linearity may limit its applicability in cases where the true relationship between variables is non-linear.
The Decision Tree model was specifically optimized with a minimum leaf size of 4, which means each leaf node in the tree must have at least 4 training examples [5]. This parameter helps control the model's complexity and prevents overfitting by ensuring that each split leaves a sufficient number of samples for reliable statistical estimation [6].

The RMSE value is a measure of the average magnitude of the error. It is the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. For our Decision Tree model, the RMSE was calculated to be 0.012325. This very low RMSE value indicates that the model's predictions are extremely close to the actual values, suggesting excellent predictive accuracy [5].

The exceptionally low RMSE value of 0.012325 demonstrates that the Decision Tree model has a very low error rate, making it highly accurate in its predictions. This suggests that the model is well-tuned and capable of capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively. The use of a minimum leaf size of 4 likely contributed to this performance by balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, thus avoiding overfitting while maintaining accuracy [5][6].

The performance of the ANN model was assessed based on two key metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R-Squared value.

This low RMSE value indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, very close to the actual values, demonstrating high predictive accuracy [3][7].

The R-Squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination, indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The R-Squared value for our model was found to be 0.97276. This means that 97.276% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. An R-Squared value of 0.97276 is generally considered very high, indicating a strong ability of the model to capture the variability in the data [3][7].

The RMSE value of 0.04272 demonstrates that the ANN model has a very low error rate, which is favorable for prediction accuracy [3]. Meanwhile, the R-Squared value of 0.97276 signifies that the ANN model captures nearly all the variability in the dataset, making it an extremely robust model for explaining the relationship between variables [3].

These performance metrics indicate that the ANN model is highly effective in modelling complex non-linear relationships within the data. The low RMSE and high R-Squared values suggest that the model has been well-trained and optimized, providing reliable and accurate predictions [3][7].

The Random Forest model was evaluated using two key performance metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R-Squared value. The RMSE provides a measure of the average magnitude of the error, calculated as the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. For our Random Forest model, the RMSE was remarkably low, calculated at 0.0024. Correspondingly, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was 0.00000576. This exceptionally low RMSE and MSE value indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, extremely close to the actual values, suggesting outstanding predictive accuracy.

The R-Squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. For our Random Forest model, the R-Squared value was found to be an impressive 0.99991. This near-perfect R-Squared value signifies that 99.991% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. Such a high R-Squared value indicates an almost perfect fit to the data, underscoring the model's ability to capture the variability and complexity within the dataset accurately.

The extremely low RMSE of 0.0024 and MSE of 0.00000576 demonstrate that the Random Forest model's error rate is minimal, enhancing its reliability for accurate predictions. Meanwhile, the R-Squared value of 0.99991 reveals that the Random Forest model captures nearly all the variability in the dataset, making it an extraordinarily robust model for explaining the relationship between variables. This high level of performance can be attributed to the ensemble nature of the Random Forest algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization to new data.
